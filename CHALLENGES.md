# Programming Challenges - Log Analysis System

Welcome to the progressive coding challenges for the Log Analysis System! These challenges are designed to test and improve your programming skills across different areas: debugging, optimization, feature implementation, and system design.

## Challenge Categories

- 🐛 **Debug**: Find and fix bugs in existing code
- ⚡ **Optimize**: Improve performance and efficiency
- 🚀 **Feature**: Add new functionality
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: Design and refactor system components

---

## Level 1: Getting Started (Easy)

### Challenge 1.1: Fix the Broken Parser 🐛
**Files**: `python/log_parser.py`

There's a bug in the log parser that causes it to fail on certain timestamp formats. Some logs use a different timezone format (`[10/Oct/2023:13:55:36 -0500]` instead of `[10/Oct/2023:13:55:36 +0000]`).

**Your Task**:
1. Create a test case that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the `_parse_timestamp` method to handle both timezone formats
3. Ensure all existing tests still pass

**Expected Outcome**: Parser should handle both `+0000` and `-0500` timezone formats.

### Challenge 1.2: Add Request Validation 🚀
**Files**: `javascript/validator.js`

The validator is missing validation for request paths in log entries. Some paths might be malicious or malformed.

**Your Task**:
1. Add a `validateLogPath` method that:
   - Rejects paths longer than 2000 characters
   - Rejects paths with dangerous patterns (like `../`, `<script>`)
   - Allows valid HTTP paths with query parameters
2. Write comprehensive tests for your validation function
3. Integrate it into the existing validation workflow

**Expected Outcome**: System safely validates and sanitizes log entry paths.

### Challenge 1.3: Improve Error Messages ⚡
**Files**: `python/models.py`, `python/log_parser.py`

Current error messages are too generic. Users need better feedback about what went wrong.

**Your Task**:
1. Create specific error classes for different failure types:
   - `InvalidIPAddressError`
   - `InvalidTimestampError`
   - `InvalidStatusCodeError`
2. Update the parser to use these specific errors
3. Include the problematic value in error messages
4. Add tests for the new error types

**Expected Outcome**: Clear, actionable error messages that help users fix their log files.

## Level 2: Intermediate Challenges

### Challenge 2.1: Memory Optimization 🐛⚡
**Files**: `python/log_parser.py`, `python/analytics.py`

The system currently loads entire log files into memory, which fails for very large files (>1GB).

**Your Task**:
1. Identify memory bottlenecks in the current implementation
2. Implement a streaming analytics approach that processes logs in chunks
3. Modify `LogAnalytics` to work with data streams instead of full datasets
4. Maintain accuracy of all analytics while using constant memory
5. Add benchmarks to measure memory usage improvement

**Constraints**: Memory usage should not exceed 100MB regardless of file size.

**Expected Outcome**: System can process multi-gigabyte log files with minimal memory usage.

### Challenge 2.2: Rate Limiting Implementation 🚀
**Files**: `javascript/server.js`, new middleware

The API needs more sophisticated rate limiting per endpoint and user type.

**Your Task**:
1. Create a flexible rate limiting middleware with:
   - Different limits for different endpoints
   - User-based rate limiting (if authenticated)
   - IP-based rate limiting with sliding window
   - Bypass for trusted IPs
2. Add rate limit headers to responses
3. Implement exponential backoff for repeated violations
4. Add comprehensive tests and monitoring

**Expected Outcome**: Robust rate limiting that prevents abuse while allowing legitimate usage.

### Challenge 2.3: Log Format Auto-Detection 🚀
**Files**: `python/log_parser.py`, new detection module

Currently, users must know their log format. The system should auto-detect formats.

**Your Task**:
1. Create a `LogFormatDetector` class that can identify:
   - Common Log Format (CLF)
   - Combined Log Format
   - Extended Log Format
   - Custom formats with response times
   - Nginx default format
   - Apache error log format
2. Implement confidence scoring for format detection
3. Handle mixed formats in the same file
4. Add support for custom delimiter detection

**Expected Outcome**: System automatically detects and parses various log formats without user input.

   - Rolling counters
   - Time-series aggregation
   - Anomaly detection
4. Handle backpressure and data buffering
5. Ensure data consistency across concurrent streams

**Expected Outcome**: System provides real-time insights with sub-second latency.

### Challenge 3.2: Machine Learning Integration 🚀🏗️
**Files**: New ML module, enhanced analytics

Add intelligent analysis capabilities using machine learning.

**Your Task**:
1. Implement anomaly detection algorithms:
   - Statistical outlier detection for traffic patterns
   - Behavioral analysis for bot detection
   - Time-series forecasting for capacity planning
2. Create a training pipeline that:
   - Learns from historical data
   - Updates models incrementally
   - Handles concept drift
3. Add confidence scores and explainable results
4. Design A/B testing framework for model evaluation

**Expected Outcome**: System intelligently identifies security threats and performance issues.

### Challenge 3.3: Multi-tenant Architecture 🏗️
**Files**: Database integration, authentication module

Scale the system to support multiple organizations with isolation.

**Your Task**:
1. Design database schema with proper tenant isolation
2. Implement authentication and authorization:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Tenant-scoped data access
3. Add resource quotas and billing tracking
4. Create admin APIs for tenant management
5. Ensure data privacy and compliance (GDPR-ready)

**Expected Outcome**: Production-ready multi-tenant SaaS platform.
