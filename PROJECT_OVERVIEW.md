- **Utilities**: Helper functions for formatting and file operations

### 🟨 **JavaScript API Layer**
- **Express Server**: RESTful API with proper middleware
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **File Processing**: Python integration for log analysis
- **Job Management**: Async processing with status tracking

### 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**
- **Python Tests**: Unit tests with pytest, 90%+ coverage
- **JavaScript Tests**: Jest tests for all modules
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Real-world error scenarios

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   ./test_system.py
   ```

2. **Run Example**:
   ```bash
   ./example.py
   ```

3. **Analyze Sample Data**:
   ```bash
   ./analyze.py data/sample.log
   ```

4. **Start API Server**:
   ```bash
   cd javascript
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
