# Expert Detail Answers - Phase 4

## Q1: Should we validate that timezone offsets are within valid ranges (-1200 to +1400)?
**Answer:** Yes

The parser should validate that timezone offsets fall within the valid range of UTC-12:00 to UTC+14:00, preventing acceptance of invalid timezones.

## Q2: Should the fallback mechanism (line 220) that strips timezone info be removed or enhanced?
**Answer:** Enhanced

The fallback mechanism should be improved to explicitly handle timezone-naive formats while maintaining the ability to parse them, avoiding silent data loss.

## Q3: Should we add explicit documentation/comments explaining timezone handling in the `_parse_timestamp` method?
**Answer:** Yes

Comprehensive documentation should be added to explain timezone handling, fallback behavior, and supported formats for better maintainability.

## Q4: Should test cases use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to cover multiple timezone variations efficiently?
**Answer:** Yes

Tests should follow the existing pattern in the codebase and use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to efficiently cover multiple timezone format variations.

## Q5: Should we add performance benchmarks to verify no regression when adding new test coverage?
**Answer:** No

Performance benchmarks are not required for this test-focused task. The current performance is adequate and adding test coverage should not impact runtime performance.
