# Discovery Answers - Phase 2

## Q1: Should the parser handle timezone-naive timestamps (no timezone at all)?
**Answer:** Yes

The parser should support logs that may not include timezone information, with appropriate fallback handling.

## Q2: Should the parser preserve timezone information in the parsed datetime objects?
**Answer:** Yes

Timezone-aware datetime objects should be maintained to prevent ambiguity and follow best practices.

## Q3: Will log files contain mixed timezone formats within the same file?
**Answer:** Yes

The parser needs to handle different timezone formats on a per-line basis, as real-world logs may mix formats from different sources.

## Q4: Should the parser support additional timestamp formats beyond Apache Common Log Format?
**Answer:** No

The parser should remain focused on Apache Common Log Format and its variants (CLF, Combined, Extended).

## Q5: Is performance a critical concern when parsing timestamps (e.g., processing millions of log entries)?
**Answer:** Yes

Performance optimization is important given the streaming implementation and memory-efficiency focus of the codebase. Solutions should avoid significant performance degradation.
